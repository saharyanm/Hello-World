  <H1> This is an excert from William Knox's Three Tracts<H1>
  <br>   The term slave having no legal signification in Great Britain and being generally for describing the subjects of the most despotic tyrants it is commonly understood 
    to denote one who has no rights his labour, property, and life being at the discretion of his mafter</br>
  <p> This definition of the term far from being a true one in respect to the Negroe slaves in the British colonies then owners have no other than a legal property in them and legal authority over them and the same laws which make them slaves give them rights 
  <p> In no British colony is the life of the slave left in the power of the owner and for cruel usage or insufficient nourishment the slave has a remedy similar to that of apprentices in England though from the ignorance the Negroe and the partiality of the magistrates who are too frequently Socii Cri minis the tyranny of the planter is much sei domer punished in America than the rigour of a master in England
